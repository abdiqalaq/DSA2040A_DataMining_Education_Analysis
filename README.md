Clean and transform the raw data.
Dataset Description

Source: 
A dataset from Kaggle containing student records covering attendance behaviour and academic performance.

Content: 
Each record corresponds to a student and includes features such as weekly self-study hours, attendance percentage, class participation, total score, and letter grade.

Challenges: 
The dataset contains inconsistent values, requiring a strong ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) approach before modelling.
