## WEEK TWO WORK

### Advanced Data Cleaning and Standardization (Kendi)
The Week 2 task focused on advanced transformation and ensuring data readiness for analysis.  

#### Key Steps Performed:
- **Handled outliers** using the IQR method to reduce skew and improve accuracy.  
- **Reduced noise** by smoothing categorical inconsistencies and removing irrelevant data.  
- **Standardized formats** across numerical and categorical columns to maintain consistency.  
- **Exported cleaned dataset** (`final_dataset.csv`) ready for analytical modelling.  

#### Output Files:
- `data/raw.csv` — Original merged dataset  
- `data/transformed.csv` — After Week 1 transformations  
- `data/final_dataset.csv` — Fully cleaned dataset after Week 2
